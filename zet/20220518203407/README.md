## Review for Class 2 of Boost

The terminal - terminal emulator based these days on stanard VT100 terminal that was invented to use a digital method of inputting data to replace teletype machine that was used before.

Command line interface - can be used without a terminal. CLI also known as a REPL. Read, evaluate, print, loop. Anything that takes input on a singel line and prints it back to you.

- Basically I type a command and computer prints back something

Shell - Interactive program (not always command line) to a deeper system. (anything that provides an interface for humans to talk to system)
