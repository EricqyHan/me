# How to make a zettelkasten entry

https://rwx.gg/lang/md/basic/

This is the body of the zettle1 (whith means "slip")

- First Bullet
- Second Bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
1. Second
1. Third
1. Fourth

```go
import "fmt"

package main
func main(){
fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

What is I want _italic_ or **bold** or **_bold italic_**?

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a url I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:
http://rwx.gg

- I put references a the bottom. Zettlekasten cool
